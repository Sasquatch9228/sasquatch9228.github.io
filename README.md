There is a single little glitch while going to the header pages; if you click on a header tab while you are on it except for the 'Exploits' tab, you will get a 404 'page not found' error code page.

To fix this just click the back button once next to the address bar if you want to go back to the header pages, or click it two times if you want to go to the main 'Exploits' website page.

I will probably fix this miniature little glitch soon, but not right now. Anyways, I hope you guys enjoy navigating through my very own first personal website!
