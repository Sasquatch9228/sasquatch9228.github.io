# Sasquatch9228's Personal Website Source Code

This GitHub repository provides the source code and files for my personal website, [sasquatch9228.github.io](https://sasquatch9228.github.io)

There is a single little glitch while going to the header pages; if you click on a header tab while you are on it except for the 'Exploits' tab, you will get a 404 'page not found' error code page.

To fix this just click the back button once next to the address bar if you want to go back to the header pages, or click it two times if you want to go to the main 'Exploits' website page.

I will probably fix this miniature little glitch soon, but not right now. Anyways, I hope you guys enjoy navigating through my very own first personal website!

Oh, and if you guys need the E-Halcyon exploit that is not listed on the website, I rehosted the website on Vercel since the original domain [fog.gay](fog.gay) has expired and the instructions might be harder to find until I list the exploit on my website soon. Here is the link that I rehosted E-Halcyon on: [e-halcyon.vercel.app](e-halcyon.vercel.app)
