            <h2>Blog Post Introduction:</h2>
            </center>
            <p>
            It was just past midnight on the morning of September 13th, 2022 (12:20 AM
            EST specifically). Almost everyone was asleep at the time. Bypassi had just been
            having a very insightful conversation with CompactCow#4717 in the
            <a href="https://discord.gg/unblock">Titanium Network Discord server</a>,
            but then he went to sleep too.
            By the time the sun rose the next morning, the landscape of bypassing
            filters would be forever changed. Over the next couple of weeks, this
            method would be used by tons of students around the world, and hundreds if
            not thousands of sysadmins would be massively trolled.
            This is the story of how LTBEEF was found, how it works, and also my
            unsolicited opinions on sysadmins and their whiny raging.
            But before we can continue, there are four questions that need to be
            answered.
            </p>
            <h2><b>1. What is a Chrome extension?</b></h2>
            <p>
            Well, they're collections of scripts running in the background of Chrome.
            Generally, blocker extensions (like GoGuardian and Securly) are
            extensions, since Chrome provides these extensions which the
            <code>chrome.webRequest</code> and <code>chrome.tabs</code> APIs, which can be
            used to block websites.
            </p>
            <h2><b>2. What are the permission levels of Chrome extensions?</b></h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Component extensions</li>
            <li>Force-installed extensions</li>
            <li>Regular or sideloaded extensions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Most people know that force-installed extensions is in the
            <code>ExtensionInstallForcelist</code> section of your district's
            <code>chrome://policy</code> setup. The point of these is that they're,
            well, forced (duh), so you aren't supposed to be able to get rid of them. Even
            if you have Inspect Element allowed, Chrome prevents you from inspecting
            force-installed extensions.
            </p>
            <p>
            But most people have never heard of a component extension. These are
            extensions that Google itself puts into Chrome. There are very, very few
            of these but it's worth noting that their permission level is higher than
            force-installed extensions. For example, they can even run code on
            <code>chrome://</code> pages if they want to. The only way to really view
            these extensions is from <code>chrome://extensions-internals</code>.
            </p>
            <h2><b>3. What are the other installable things that aren't Chrome extensions?</b></h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Chrome Themes</li>
            <li>Packaged apps</li>
            <li>Hosted apps</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            The difference between packaged apps and hosted apps is huge. Packaged apps are just regular apps and games such as
            <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cut-the-rope/jfbadlndcminbkfojhlimnkgaackjmdo">Cut the Rope</a>.
            <b>Hosted apps, on the other hand, are like instructions to the browser telling them to act as if some website is an application.</b>
            That website will then be able to access stuff that an application would, along with extra permissions in the downloaded manifest file.
            </p>
            <img src="detail/LTBEEF/archive/blog/sasquatch9228/detail/LTBEEF/assets/app-battle.png"/>
            <p>
            There are very few practical uses for hosted apps; at best, they can allow
            gaming websites to use accelerated 3D rendering. When a hosted app is
            downloaded, clicking on its launcher icon will just take you to the website itself.
            Since these apps are so useless (and because they use
            <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/mv2-sunset/">Manifest V2</a>), 
            Google is no longer allowing hosted apps to be downloaded from the
            Chrome Web Store. Eventually, they will be fully phased out.
            </p>
            <h2><b>4. What is the <code>management</code> permission?</b></h2>
            <p>
            This permission can be requested by extensions, and it
            <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/management/">allows them to enable or disable other extensions</a>. But there is a catch.
            <b>Extensions can only disable extensions on the same or lower level than them.</b>
            For example, an Chrome extension that you install yourself could not disable a
            force-installed Chrome extension such as GoGuardian or Securly, even if it has <code>management</code> permissions.
            Another interesting quirk is that only regular or sideloaded Chrome extensions
            are allowed to use <code>chrome.management.uninstallSelf()</code>, but
            <code>chrome.management.setEnabled()</code> is fair game on force-installed
            Chrome extensions too (assuming it passes the permission level checks).
            Phew, that's a lot to remember. With all this said, let's get into the
            workings of LTBEEF.
            </p>
            <h2><b>The workings of the LTBEEF exploit</b></h2>
            <p>
            Before CompactCow (the Discord guy) went to sleep, he brought up the fact
            that the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Web Store website</a> seemed
            to have a permission called <code>chrome.webstorePrivate</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
            So a website has special permissions. Sounds familiar? Yep, turns out that there is a
            <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chrome/browser/resources/webstore_app/manifest.json">hosted app called "Web Store"</a>
            built into every Chrome installation. What's more, <b>this glorified website is on the component (highest) level.</b> You can
            see the "application" for yourself by searching for it in the ChromeOS launch menu.
            </p>
            <p>
            And guess which other permission they gave it? That's right, the <code>management</code> permission.
            </p>
            <p>
            So. Wait. <kbd>chrome.google.com/webstore</kbd> can disable forced admin-installed extensions? Surely not-
            </p>
            <p>
            Oh. It can.
            </p>
